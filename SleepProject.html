            <h1>Sleep Project</h1>
            <h2>Sleep Mask, Performance </h2>

            <p> Before industrialisation people used to wake up in the middle of the
                night and use the time to write, read or have sex - later they went back to sleep again. Because of
                industrialisation it became more and more important for people to sleep 8h during the night so that
                during the day one could become a fully productive member of society. As everyone has the same sleep
                rhythme, one gets traped in this system of 8h sleep every night.
                <br><br>
                How could we become more aware of our sleep and own it even during the day? <br>
                Through the Sleep Mask we can immerse into a warm, dark and good smeling enviroment. Therefore we are
                able to relax and fall asleep, when ever we want while out and about.

                Performance: Four students infront of the Toni-Areal, discussing and complaining about their
                everyday problems. In particular their sleep rhythm, as for an Interaction Designer whose
                near the end of a module, sleep tends to get less and less. Except for one student, whose
                wearing the new sleepmask. In comparison with the other students the one with the
                mask gets control over their own sleep rhythm. During the performance one can
                observe that the student with the mask ends the conversation, because the mask tells her
                it’s the perfect time to take a nap. The lenses start to darken and steam with melatonin
                starts to rise in order to get the student into a relaxed mode. The mask gets a warm cozy
                temperature, perfect to fall asleep. The students looks around the Toni Areal and
                decides to sleep next to a pillar under the sky.<br> -->
